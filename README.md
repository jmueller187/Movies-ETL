# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide code that automated the process used to take in new data, perform the appropriate transformations, and load the data into existing tables. We were tasked with refactoring the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files — Wikipedia data (.json file), Kaggle metadata (.csv file), and the MovieLens rating data (.csv file) — performs the Extract Transform Load process and the adds the data to a PostgreSQL database.
